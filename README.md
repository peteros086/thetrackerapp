# Effective Team Dynamics Website

I moved the ETD app onto a website.  Now people can access it much easier.

## Frontend

Written in React with react-bootstrap.  I used a creative-tim template.

## Backend

Python and Flask (the dream team).  Hosted on AWS using my personal account.  I am paying for it now using my debit card, but that should change if the website gets actual use.
